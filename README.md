# TriviaGame



Overview

In this app, I created a Wine and Spirits Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. I used this app with valid HTML along with a stylish CSS to create a wine themed game.

In this trivia game only show one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

If the player selects the correct answer, a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option will be shown. After a few seconds, the next question will be display -- no user input will be required to show the next question.

The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

If the player runs out of time, the player will be shown that time's up and the correct answer. After a few seconds, then show the next question.
If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player will be shown the wrong option was selected and the correct answer. After a few seconds, then show the next question.
On the final screen, the player is show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
